### Description:

A full stack project with user authentication that interacts with the Clarifai API to detect faces in user submited pictures.<br><br>
It uses React.js for the front-end, Node.js and Express for the back-end server, and a PostgreSQL database (using Knex.js to build queries). It also makes use of bcrypt to encrypt user passwords.<br><br>
The project is hosted on Heroku, so it may take a few moments to load and make requests.

### Goals:
This project was part of the Zero to Mastery online course, the main goal was to learn more about back-end technologies, how to integrate them with the front-end, and how to deploy a fullstack application.

### Description:

A fullstack project, part of the ZTM Udemy course, which uses React.js for the front-end, Node.js and Express for the back-end server, and PostgreSQL with Knex to build the database.<br>
It interacts with the Clarifai API in order to detect faces in user submited pictures.<br><br>
The project is hosted on Heroku, so it may take a few moments to load and make requests.

### Goals:
To learn more about back-end technologies, how to integrate them with the front-end, and how to deploy a fullstack application.

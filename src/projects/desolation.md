### About the website:
A fully responsive, fast and SEO-friendly website which showcases a video game I've built.<br>
I made use of several Bootstrap features such as grid layout, carousel and modal components, to achieve my envisioned design.<br>
As the website uses many images to showcase the game, I had to keep file sizes in mind. to minimize file sizes, I compressed all images and chose appropriate file formats, such as replacing a .gif file with a lighter weight .mov file, which not only drastically decreased the file size but it also had much higher visual quality.

### About the game:
Desolation is an action RPG video game for PC developed using RPG Maker VX Ace, it has a massive world with over 400 maps and takes about 14 hours to complete.
This is a solo project which involved developing all the maps using both the RPG Maker engine and image editing software, editing and writing custom scripts in RGSS - a scripting language based on Ruby, story writing, game design and extensive testing.

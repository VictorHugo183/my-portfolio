### Description:
This is my solution to a Frontend Mentor challenge. The challenge is to build out a landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.<br>
Users are able to view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size and see active states for all interactive elements on the page.


### Goals:
To practice creating a website from a given design and styles specification.

### What I learned:
<ul style="list-style: inside; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
  <li>How to create a navigation element where the design for desktop and mobile are significantly different.</li>
  <li>How to toggle dropdown menus with JavaScript, so that only the current active menu is visible.</li>
  <li>A better understanding of CSS, including image backgrounds and positioning (relative vs. absolute)</li>
</ul>
